# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a simple sample Greengrass Lite component that demonstrates how to use the Token Exchange Service (TES) feature to obtain AWS credentials. The component is designed for learning purposes and will be as simple as possible while clearly showing how to use the TES service.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Greengrass component developer, I want a minimal example that shows how to obtain AWS credentials from the TES service, so that I can learn how to use this feature in my own components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the component starts THEN it SHALL connect to the local TES service.
2. WHEN connected to TES THEN it SHALL request AWS credentials.
3. WHEN credentials are received THEN it SHALL print them to stdout in a readable format.
4. WHEN an error occurs THEN it SHALL print a clear error message.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Greengrass component developer, I want the sample code to be clear and well-commented, so that I can easily understand how to use the TES service.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the code THEN it SHALL be minimal and focused only on the TES functionality.
2. WHEN reading the code THEN it SHALL have clear comments explaining the key parts of the implementation.
3. WHEN implementing the component THEN it SHALL use the simplest possible C implementation.
4. WHEN running the component THEN it SHALL demonstrate the core functionality without unnecessary complexity.
